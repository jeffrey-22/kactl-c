 * Description: Min-cost max-flow. cap[i][j] != cap[j][i] is allowed; double edges are not.
 *  If costs can be negative, call setpi before maxflow, but note that negative cost cycles are not supported.
 *  To obtain the actual flow, look at positive values only.
 * Status: Tested on kattis:mincostmaxflow, stress-tested against another implementation
 * Time: Approximately O(E^2)
